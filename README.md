# Code wars Test
  
  
## Profiles
1. **Front-end developers** - Will be working in HTML, CSS, front-end frameworks and a bit in javascript.
2. **Javascript developers** - Will be working with javascript and its libraries (eg: jQuery) and HTML.
3. **Back-end developers** - Will be working with Python, Flask/Django framework and database.  
  
  
## Task

### Front-end developers
* Make a profile page. Screenshot is given for reference.
* Use any other good design you want or similar to the one given.
* Layout should look good on different desktop sizes.
* Use bootstrap or material framework to make a screen-size responsive page.
* Add hover effect on menu or suitable items.

### Javascript developers
* Consider the following game :  
Numbers from 1 to 25 are randomly placed on the maze and the player has to bring them in order only by swapping.  
The only controls allowed are arrow keys and enter key.  
To swap cell A and B, player goes to A and stores the number in A by pressing enter.  
Then goes to B and presses enter again. This will swap the values and storage will become free.  
* You have to write functions to support the needed movements in this game.
* A random matrix of 25 numbers is given in the JS file. When page loads, these values must be displayed in cells.
* Use event listeners for keyboard movement.
* Although you need to write code only in the JS file, you need to read the HTML code and see the class and ids used in maze. 
* I have made a 'active' class to highlight the current cell. You just need to remove and add this class from/to appropriate cell.
* Cell should become empty when we take its value to storage.
* Similarly, storage should again become None when swapping is complete.

### Back-end developers
* Make a simple program to manage accounts and generate leaderboard.
* Use the JSON file to load/write data of users.
* You must know about arrays and dictionaries and manipulating JSON.
* Make functions to read and write data from/to file. Refer the function provided in base code.
* Make a function to create a new user taking its details and applying suitable checks (some are shown in screenshot).
* Edit option is simulating login and then asking what details are to be changed.
* Simply show the users in descending order of score to generate leaderboard.
* Try to use in-built sort function. If you face trouble, make your own sorting.

## Note
* Each task will require around 100 lines of code and probably less than 2 hours.
* Base code is given in all tasks to start.
* Screenshot is provided for all tasks.
* Use meaningful names for variables, class/id (in HTML)
* Some reference websites : stackoverflow, mdn reference, w3schools, css-tricks
